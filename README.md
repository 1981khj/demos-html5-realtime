# What?

These are small demos using two or more clients interacting with each other in real time. Most demos has a recorder
and a screen. The recorder are used as a "remote control" to control whats going on on the remote "screen".
These demos does show some new and experimental parts in browsers using native implementations so each demo might
require different browser versions / experimental browser builds.
